# Using the Light SDK

The light sdk exposes the following modules:

```rust 
pub mod reading; // exposes queries to retrieve data from a Namada node
pub mod transaction; // contains functions to construct all the transactions currently supported by the protocol
pub mod writing; // exposes functions to send data to a Namada node
pub use namada_sdk; // exposes the namada_sdk module for low level interactions with the Namada node
```

The functions exposed by each of these modules (excluding `namada_sdk`) are described in the following sections.

- [Reading](./usage/reading.mdx)
- [Transaction](./usage/transactions.mdx)
- [Writing](./usage/writing.mdx)
