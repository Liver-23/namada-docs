## Writing

The writing module exposes the broadcast function to send transactions to a Namada node.

```rust
pub fn broadcast_tx(tendermint_addr: &str, tx: Tx) -> Result<Response, Error> {...}
```
The Tx object can be retrieved from the transaction module by calling the `::payload()` method on the transaction object. See [transaction](./transactions.mdx) for more details.
