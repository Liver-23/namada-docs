# Importing the Light SDK

The Light SDK can be imported into your project using the following line in your `cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[package]
name = "namada-light-sdk-starter"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2021"

[dependencies]
async-std = "1.11.0"
futures = "0.3.28"
getrandom = { version = "0.2" }
rand = {version = "0.8", default-features = false}
rand_core = {version = "0.6", default-features = false}
serde = { version = "1.0.188", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.107" 
namada_light_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/anoma/namada.git", rev = "v0.31.8"} # The feature `asynchronous` is used by default. For the `blocking` feature, add the features = ["blocking"] line.
tendermint-config = "0.34.0"
tendermint-rpc = { version = "0.34.0", features = ["http-client"]}
tokio = {version = "1.8.2", default-features = false}
tempfile = "3.8.0"
async-trait = "0.1.74"
markdown-gen = "1.2.1"
reqwest = "0.11.22"
minio = "0.1.0"
itertools = "0.12.0"

[build-dependencies]
vergen = { version = "8.0.0", features = ["build", "git", "gitcl"] }
```

## Asynchronous vs blocking

The light sdk is compartmentalized into two features: `asynchronous` and `blocking`. The `asynchronous` feature is used by default. For the `blocking` feature, add the `features = ["blocking"]` line to the `namada_light_sdk` dependency in your `cargo.toml` file.

```toml
...
namada_light_sdk = { git = "https://github.com/anoma/namada.git", rev = "v0.31.8", features = ["blocking"]}
...
```

These features differ in the way that they interact with the protocol. The `asynchronous` feature uses the `async-std` runtime, while the `blocking` feature uses the `tokio` runtime. The `asynchronous` feature is recommended for new projects, as it is more efficient and easier to work with.
